    "\n",
    "x='habitat': Indicates that the histogram is based on the habitat column.\n",
    "\n",
    "hue='poisonous': Adds color to the histogram based on the poisonous column (0 for edible, 1 for poisonous).\n",
    "\n",
    "palette={0: 'green', 1: 'red'}: Assigns green to edible mushrooms and red to poisonous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "multiple='stack': Stacks the histogram bars for each category (edible and poisonous) on top of each other to show their distribution within each habitat category.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### iii) Save the Plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.savefig(os.path.join(visuals_folder, \"habitat_hist.png\"))\n",

    "\n",
    "I identified that 30% of the stalk-root column contains missing values and decided to impute (fill) these with the most frequent value (the mode):\n",

    "dataset = dataset.drop('veil-type', axis=1):\n",
    "\n",
    "This removes the 'veil-type' column from the DataFrame.\n",
    "The reason for dropping this column is because, based on the previous check, it likely contains only one unique value (i.e., it doesn't provide any useful information for classification). \n",
    "\n",
    "Columns with a single unique value do not contribute to model learning, as they don't offer variability or help distinguish between different classes.\n",
    "axis=1 indicates that you are dropping a column (if it were axis=0, you'd be dropping rows).\n",

    "\n",
    "This code performs a train-test split on the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1) Extracting independent variables (x):\n",
    "\n",
    "x = dataset.iloc[:,:20].values: \n",
    "\n",
    "This selects the first 20 columns of the dataset (i.e., all features except the target variable) and stores them in x. The .values converts the DataFrame into a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2) Extracting dependent variable (y):\n",
    "\n",
    "y = dataset.iloc[:,[-1]].values: This selects the last column of the dataset (the target variable) and stores it in y as a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3) Train-test split:\n",
    "\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=45):\n",
    "This splits the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "test_size=0.2 means 20% of the data will be used for testing, and 80% will be used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "random_state=45 ensures that the split is reproducible. Every time you run the code with this random state, the same split will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4) Checking the dimensions of the splits:\n",
    "\n",
    "X_train.shape, y_train.shape: These commands print the dimensions of the training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "X_test.shape, y_test.shape: These commands print the dimensions of the testing sets.\n",

    "##### 5) ROC Curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_pred_ini)\n",
    "roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is generated to show the performance of the model at different classification thresholds. It plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is calculated to summarize the overall performance of the ROC curve. A higher AUC value indicates better model performance.\n",

    "##### 6) F1 Score:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(classification_report(y_test, logmodel_ini.predict(X_test), target_names=target_names))\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score, precision, and recall are calculated and displayed in a classification report. \n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, making it a good metric for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7) Log Loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "log_loss(y_test, logmodel_ini.predict(X_test))\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithmic Loss (Log Loss) measures the performance of a classification model by penalizing false classifications. A lower value indicates a better model.\n",

    "The best 𝐶 value for your model, based on the highest cross-validation accuracy, is printed and visualized through the plot. This helps you choose the optimal regularization strength for your Logistic Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I) Using different regularization models to find the best performing model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of MY workflow, I am applying three different types of regularization models for Logistic Regression: \n",

    "Here's a breakdown of each model and the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1) L2 Regularization (Ridge) Model\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "LogisticRegression(C=10, penalty='l2', solver='liblinear'): Initializes a logistic regression model with L2 regularization (ridge). \n",
    "\n",
    "C is the inverse of the regularization strength; smaller values mean stronger regularization. \n",
    "\n",
    "penalty='l2' specifies L2 regularization, and solver='liblinear' is used for small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "fit(X_train, y_train): Trains the model using the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "coef_: Gets the coefficients of the features from the trained model.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 2) L1 Regularization (Lasso) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "penalty='l1': Specifies L1 regularization (lasso). This can lead to sparse solutions where some feature coefficients are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the code is similar to the L2 model for training and predicting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy Calculation:\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 4) Summary\n",
    "L2 (Ridge) Regularization: Useful for reducing model complexity and preventing overfitting by shrinking the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 (Lasso) Regularization: Useful for feature selection as it can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively removing them from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regularization: Combines both L1 and L2 regularization to balance feature selection and coefficient shrinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the accuracy scores from these different models, you can choose the regularization technique that best fits your data and model performance requirements.\n",
    "\n",

    "joblib.dump: This function serializes and saves the Python object (in this case, a trained model) to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "os.path.join(model_folder, \"filename.pkl\"): Combines the folder path with the file name to create the full path where each model will be saved.\n",
